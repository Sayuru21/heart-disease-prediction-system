            <div className="mx-5 my-5">
                <h2 className="mb-5">What is Heart Disease?</h2>
                <p className="fs-4">Heart disease is a general term that
                    refers to a variety of conditions that affect
                    the heart, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart valve disorders.
                    These conditions can develop over time due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors,
                    such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise, and poor
                    diet.</p>
                <h2 className="my-5">What are the types of Heart Diseases?</h2>
                <p className="fs-4">There are many different heart conditions and problems which are collectively
                    called heart disease.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">It’s always best to discuss your heart condition with your health professional or
                    heart specialist who can advise you on the correct diagnosis and name of your condition and
                    treatment plan.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">Heart disease and different conditions affect the heart’s ability to work
                    efficiently.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">It can be worrying and confusing to be diagnosed with a heart condition, but
                    there's a lot of information and support available to you. Sometimes understanding what is
                    happening can help you worry less.</p>

                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Coronary heart disease
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    The most common heart condition is coronary heart disease. This is caused when the
                    heart’s blood vessels - the coronary arteries - become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply
                    enough blood to the heart.
                </p>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    It can lead to angina and/or a heart attack.
                </p>

                <h4 className="my-5">
                    Angina
                </h4>
                <p className="fs-4">Angina is a pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, stomach or jaw that
                    happens when the blood supply to your heart becomes restricted because of your arteries
                    becoming narrowed. This clogging is called atheroma. Angina is a symptom of coronary heart
                    disease, not an illness in itself.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">Angina is your heart’s way of telling you it’s not getting enough oxygen
                    when you’re doing something strenuous or you’re feeling under stress. Many people learn to
                    recognise how much activity will bring on an angina attack - this is called stable
                    angina.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">If you have unexplained chest pain, seek urgent medical advice - you will
                    need an assessment of your overall health.</p>

                <h4 className="my-5">
                    Unstable angina
                </h4>
                <p className="fs-4">Unstable angina can be undiagnosed chest pain or a sudden worsening of
                    existing angina. It happens when the blood supply to the heart is severely restricted and
                    angina attacks occur more frequently, with less and less activity.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">These attacks may even happen at rest or wake you from sleep. They can last
                    up to 10 minutes.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">You should see your doctor urgently, and you may be admitted to
                    hospital.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">Until tests confirm the diagnosis, this is sometimes called Acute Coronary
                    Syndrome (ACS).</p>

                <h4 className="my-5">
                    Heart attack
                </h4>
                <p className="fs-4">A heart attack - also known as myocardial infarction or MI - happens when
                    the blood supply to part of your heart muscle becomes completely blocked. This is most
                    commonly caused by a piece of fatty material breaking off and a blood clot forms within a
                    coronary artery. This can cause damage to the part of your heart muscle which that
                    particular coronary artery was supplying.</p>


                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Heart failure
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    If the heart’s pumping action can’t work effectively, your heart muscle can’t meet your body’s
                    demand for blood and oxygen, and your body develops various different symptoms, like fatigue and
                    shortness of breath. This is called heart failure because of the failure of your heart to work
                    efficiently.
                </p>
                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms)
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    The heart muscle has its own electrical system which helps to stimulate the heartbeat. If the
                    electrical signals within your heart are interrupted or disturbed, your heart can beat too
                    quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) and/or in an irregular way. This is called an
                    arrhythmia.
                </p>
                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Valve disease
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    The valves open and close to regulate the flow of blood through the heart. Problems with the
                    valves can increase the workload of your heart and can put a strain on your heart muscle,
                    leading to a range of symptoms, like:
                </p>
                <ul className="fs-4">
                    <li>shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>swollen ankles</li>
                    <li>fatigue</li>
                    <li>chest pain (angina or palpitations)</li>
                    <li>dizziness or fainting</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 className="my-5">
                    High blood pressure
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    Another condition which can affect the heart is high blood pressure or hypertension. Although
                    it’s not a disease in itself, hypertension can lead to an increased risk of developing serious
                    conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes.
                </p>

                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Congenital heart conditions
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    Congenital heart conditions occur when there’s an abnormality or defect with the structure of
                    the heart of a developing foetus while inside the mother’s womb. A baby may be born with only
                    one defect or with several defects. Some types of congenital heart defects are life-threatening,
                    either immediately to the newborn or over time.
                </p>
                <h3 className="my-5">
                    Inherited heart conditions
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    Inherited conditions can be passed on through families. They are sometimes called familial or
                    genetic heart conditions.
                </p>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    They can affect people of any age and can be life-threatening. The first sign there’s a problem
                    is often when someone dies suddenly with no obvious cause.
                </p>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    These conditions are different from most congenital heart conditions, although some congenital
                    conditions can also be inherited.
                </p>

                <h3 className="my-5">
                    High blood pressure
                </h3>
                <p className="fs-4">
                    The most common heart condition in Scotland is coronary heart disease. This is caused when the
                    heart’s blood vessels - the coronary arteries - become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply
                    enough blood to the heart.
                </p>
                <h2 className="my-5">What are the risk factors for cardiovascular disease?</h2>
                <p className="fs-4">The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are
                    unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of
                    behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose,
                    raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured
                    in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and
                    other complications.</p>

                <p className="fs-4">Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and
                    vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce
                    the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making
                    healthy choices affordable and available are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain
                    healthy behaviours.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">There are also a number of underlying determinants of CVDs. These are a reflection
                    of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change – globalization, urbanization and
                    population ageing. Other determinants of CVDs include poverty, stress and hereditary factors.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">In addition, drug treatment of hypertension, diabetes and high blood lipids are
                    necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent heart attacks and strokes among people with
                    these conditions. </p>

                <h2 className="my-5">What are common symptoms of cardiovascular diseases?</h2>
                <p className="fs-4">Often, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart
                    attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack
                    include:</p>
                <ul className="fs-4">
                    <li>pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest</li>
                    <li>pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="fs-4">In addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of
                    breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are
                    more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">TThe most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg,
                    most often on one side of the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of:</p>
                <ul className="fs-4">
                    <li>numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body</li>
                    <li>confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech</li>
                    <li>difficulty seeing with one or both eyes</li>
                    <li>difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination</li>
                    <li>severe headache with no known cause</li>
                    <li>fainting or unconsciousness</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="fs-4"></p>


                <h2 className="my-5">When to see a doctor</h2>
                <p className="fs-4">Seek emergency medical care if you have these heart disease symptoms:</p>
                <ul className="fs-4">
                    <li>Chest pain</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Fainting</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="fs-4">Always call 1990 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a
                    heart attack.</p>
                <p className="fs-4">Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Talk to your health care
                    provider if you have any concerns about your heart health. Together, you and your provider can
                    discuss ways to reduce your heart disease risk. This is especially important if you have a
                    family history of heart disease.</p>
